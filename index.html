        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am student at Stevens Institute of Technology, working towards my Master's degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning. Graduating in May 2023. In May 2022, I graduated as valedictorian of the undergraduate class of 2022, after studying Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          On campus, I served as President of the Stevens Computer Science Club, an active member of our chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, a Peer Leader where I help new students transition to Stevens, and a resident assistant where I foster an inclusive living community.
